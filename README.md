## KKOSM Website

A project dedicated to developing the official website for KKOSM (Kvemo Kartli Organisation of Scout Movement). This website will serve as a central platform for information, activities, and community engagement.

## Architecture  

The KKOSM website follows a simple and organized structure to ensure maintainability and ease of development.  

### Project Structure  
```plaintext
KKOSM-website/
│── src/             # Main project directory  
│   ├── media/       # Stores images, videos, and other media files  
│   ├── scripts/     # JavaScript files for interactive functionality  
│   ├── index.html   # Main HTML file (homepage)  
│   ├── style.css    # Global styles for the website  
│── README.md        # Project documentation  
```

### How It Works  
- **HTML (`index.html`)** - Defines the structure of the website.  
- **CSS (`style.css`)** - Manages the styling and layout.  
- **JavaScript (`scripts/`)** - Adds interactivity and dynamic features.  
- **Media (`media/`)** - Contains images and other assets used on the site.  

This architecture ensures a clean separation of concerns, making it easier to scale and manage.
